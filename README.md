# Prototype for submitting crypto portfolio proposal.

In this Challenge, we combined our financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that we acquired in the 10th module.

We created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. Then plot the results so that you can visually check the performance to the board.

The CSV file thatâ€™s provided for this Challenge contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

This indicates that a k value of 4 is optimal when we use the original features

Analysis of K-means clusters with k=4 using Percentage Change over 1y vs 14d

This indicates, similar to k means clustering on original features, that a k value of 4 is optimal when we reduced the original features to 3 using PCA.
